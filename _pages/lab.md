**Embodied Intelligence and Robotic Systems (EMOBIDCA) Lab** at Nanjing University
Funded and Led by Dr. Zhenshan Bing, the EMOBIDCA Lab specializes in embodied artificial intelligence and robotics. Our research explores the challenges of autonomous control for embodied robots in complex, real-world environments. We aim to develop robotic systems that are not only highly generalizable but also scalable across a wide range of applications.
