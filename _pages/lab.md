    <p>
      <strong>Embodied Intelligence and Robotic Systems (EMOBIDCA) Lab</strong>, founded and led by Dr. Zhenshan Bing, specializes in embodied artificial intelligence and robotics. Our research explores the challenges of autonomous control for embodied robots in complex, real-world environments. We aim to develop robotic systems that are not only highly generalizable but also scalable across a wide range of applications.
