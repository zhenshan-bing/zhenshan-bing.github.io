ABSTRACT={The development of advanced autonomous driving applications is hindered by the complex temporal structure of sensory data, as well as by the limited computational and energy resources of their on-board systems. Currently, neuromorphic engineering is a rapidly growing field that aims to design information processing systems similar to the human brain by leveraging novel algorithms based on spiking neural networks (SNNs). These systems are well-suited to recognize temporal patterns in data while maintaining a low energy consumption and offering highly parallel architectures for fast computation. However, the lack of effective algorithms for SNNs impedes their wide usage in mobile robot applications. This paper addresses the problem of radar signal processing by introducing a novel SNN that substitutes the discrete Fourier transform and constant false-alarm rate algorithm for raw radar data, where the weights and architecture of the SNN are derived from the original algorithms. We demonstrate that our proposed SNN can achieve competitive results compared to that of the original algorithms in simulated driving scenarios while retaining its spike-based nature.},

    abstract = { The target-oriented spraying is an effective way to minimize chemical input in agricultural production and it is important to actualizing sustainable agriculture. This article focused on the design and optimization of the target spray platform. The spray platform consists of three parts: the vision system, the spray system, and the moving platform. All components were effectively connected and preliminarily evaluated especially regarding the response time and target spray accuracy. A simulation system was built considering the real crop geometric shape and nozzle spray pattern using the Monte Carlo method. The spray simulator was used to optimize the spray height objective function of spray deposition rate and coefficient of variance for the spray deposition. The spray process can be easily visualized and compared for different spray parameters. The indoor experiment setup was built to test and optimize the parameters of the overall system, which is flexible to verify the system. Afterward, the outdoor tractor-based equipment was designed to test the system for the field environment. The experimental result showed that 80\% of the crop had a spray deviation from 0 mm to 28 mm and the proposed spraying system can reduce 46.8\% usage of the chemical compared to the uniform spray method. }

  title = {Towards autonomous locomotion: {CPG}-based control of smooth 3D slithering gait transition of a snake-like robot},
  journal = {Bioinspiration {\&}amp$\mathsemicolon$ Biomimetics},
  abstract = {Snake-like robots with 3D locomotion ability have significant advantages of adaptive travelling in diverse complex terrain over traditional legged or wheeled mobile robots. Despite numerous developed gaits, these snake-like robots suffer from unsmooth gait transitions by changing the locomotion speed, direction, and body shape, which would potentially cause undesired movement and abnormal torque. Hence, there exists a knowledge gap for snake-like robots to achieve autonomous locomotion. To address this problem, this paper presents the smooth slithering gait transition control based on a lightweight central pattern generator (CPG) model for snake-like robots. First, based on the convergence behavior of the gradient system, a lightweight CPG model with fast computing time was designed and compared with other widely adopted CPG models. Then, by reshaping the body into a more stable geometry, the slithering gait was modified, and studied based on the proposed CPG model, including the gait transition of locomotion speed, moving direction, and body shape. In contrast to sinusoid-based method, extensive simulations and prototype experiments finally demonstrated that smooth slithering gait transition can be effectively achieved using the proposed CPG-based control method without generating undesired locomotion and abnormal torque.},

ABSTRACT={Biological intelligence processes information using impulses or spikes, which makes those living creatures able to perceive and act in the real world exceptionally well and outperform state-of-the-art robots in almost every aspect of life. To make up the deficit, emerging hardware technologies and software knowledge in the fields of neuroscience, electronics, and computer science have made it possible to design biologically realistic robots controlled by spiking neural networks (SNNs), inspired by the mechanism of brains. However, a comprehensive review on controlling robots based on SNNs is still missing. In this paper, we survey the developments of the past decade in the field of spiking neural networks for control tasks, with particular focus on the fast emerging robotics-related applications. We first highlight the primary impetuses of SNN-based robotics tasks in terms of speed, energy efficiency, and computation capabilities. We then classify those SNN-based robotic applications according to different learning rules and explicate those learning rules with their corresponding robotic applications. We also briefly present some existing platforms that offer an interaction between SNNs and robotics simulations for exploration and exploitation. Finally, we conclude our survey with a forecast of future challenges and some associated potential research topics in terms of controlling robots based on SNNs.}

ABSTRACT={Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer many advantages over traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs) such as biological plausibility, fast information processing, and energy efficiency. Although SNNs have been used to solve a variety of control tasks using the Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP) learning rule, existing solutions usually involve hard-coded network architectures solving specific tasks rather than solving different kinds of tasks generally. This results in neglecting one of the biggest advantages of ANNs, i.e., being general-purpose and easy-to-use due to their simple network architecture, which usually consists of an input layer, one or multiple hidden layers and an output layer. This paper addresses the problem by introducing an end-to-end learning approach of spiking neural networks constructed with one hidden layer and reward-modulated Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (R-STDP) synapses in an all-to-all fashion. We use the supervised reward-modulated Spike-Timing-Dependent-Plasticity learning rule to train two different SNN-based sub-controllers to replicate a desired obstacle avoiding and goal approaching behavior, provided by pre-generated datasets. Together they make up a target-reaching controller, which is used to control a simulated mobile robot to reach a target area while avoiding obstacles in its path. We demonstrate the performance and effectiveness of our trained SNNs to achieve target reaching tasks in different unknown scenarios.},

ABSTRACT={Vision based-target tracking ability is crucial to bio-inspired snake robots for exploring unknown environments. However, it is difficult for the traditional vision modules of snake robots to overcome the image blur resulting from periodic swings. A promising approach is to use a neuromorphic vision sensor (NVS), which mimics the biological retina to detect a target at a higher temporal frequency and in a wider dynamic range. In this study, an NVS and a spiking neural network (SNN) were performed on a snake robot for the first time to achieve pipe-like object tracking. An SNN based on Hough Transform was designed to detect a target with an asynchronous event stream fed by the NVS. Combining the state of snake motion analyzed by the joint position sensors, a tracking framework was proposed. The experimental results obtained from the simulator demonstrated the validity of our framework and the autonomous locomotion ability of our snake robot. Comparing the performances of the SNN model on CPUs and on GPUs, respectively, the SNN model showed the best performance on a GPU under a simplified and synchronous update rule while it possessed higher precision on a CPU in an asynchronous way.},

However, the implementations of SNNs in robotic fields are limited due to the lack of practical training methods. In this paper, we therefore introduce both indirect and direct end-to-end training methods of SNNs for a lane-keeping vehicle. First, we adopt a policy learned using the Deep Q-Learning (DQN) algorithm and then subsequently transfer it to an SNN using supervised learning. Second, we adopt the reward-modulated spike-timing-dependent plasticity (R-STDP) for training SNNs directly, since it combines the advantages of both reinforcement learning and the well-known spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). We examine the proposed approaches in three scenarios in which a robot is controlled to keep within lane markings by using an event-based neuromorphic vision sensor. We further demonstrate the advantages of the R-STDP approach in terms of the lateral localization accuracy and training time steps by comparing them with other three algorithms presented in this paper.},

ABSTRACT={Visual-guided locomotion for snake-like robots is a challenging task, since it involves not only the complex body undulation with many joints, but also a joint pipeline that connects the vision and the locomotion. Meanwhile, it is usually difficult to jointly coordinate these two separate sub-tasks as this requires time-consuming and trial-and-error tuning. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for solving target tracking tasks for a snake-like robot as a whole using a model-free reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm. This RL-based controller directly maps the visual observations to the joint positions of the snake-like robot in an end-to-end fashion instead of dividing the process into a series of sub-tasks. With a novel customized reward function, our RL controller is trained in a dynamically changing track scenario. The controller is evaluated in four different tracking scenarios and the results show excellent adaptive locomotion ability to the unpredictable behavior of the target. Meanwhile, the results also prove that the RL-based controller outperforms the traditional model-based controller in terms of tracking accuracy.}
